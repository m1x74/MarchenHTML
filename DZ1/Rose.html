<h2>Player profile</h2>
<p>Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and weighing 200 pounds (91 kg), Rose plays mostly at the point guard position.
    He averages 18.5 points per game for his career. He has never been a knock-down shooter from the arc, shooting
    30 percent for his career. He developed into a bank-shot shooter during the 2015â€“16 season after struggling
    with his jump shot due to what he attributes to depth perception issues following eye surgery in 2015.

    In Rose's prime in Chicago, he was widely considered to be <b>one of the most athletic point guards in NBA
        history</b>
    before a string of knee injuries slowed him down. A combination of explosiveness, leaping ability and speed
    allowed him to attack the basket frequently and he could also make passes to teammates. Rose clocked in a maximum
    vertical jump of 40 inches during the 2008 NBA Combine.</p>
