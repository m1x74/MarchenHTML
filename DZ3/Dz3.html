            alt="rose" width="400px" class="imgstart"><b>Derrick Martell Rose</b> (born October 4, 1988) is an American professional basketball player
        for the New York
        Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played one year of college basketball for the Memphis
        Tigers
        before
        being drafted first overall by his hometown Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA draft. He was named the NBA Rookie of
        the Year and also became the youngest player to win the NBA Most Valuable Player Award in 2011 at age 22.

        Rose was born and raised in Chicago, and attended Simeon Career Academy. He was highly recruited by colleges,
        eventually choosing to join the University of Memphis under coach John Calipari. Rose led the Tigers to the most
        wins in NCAA history (a 38–2 record), their first number 1 ranking in 25 years, and an appearance in the NCAA
        championship game. In 2009, an NCAA investigation revealed that Rose's SAT scores had been invalidated, and as a
        result, the NCAA vacated Memphis' entire 2007–08 season.

        Rose has struggled with significant knee injuries since his 2010–11 MVP season. In the first round of the 2012
        NBA
        playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose tore his ACL in his left knee. Rose required surgery and was
        subsequently sidelined for the entire 2012–13 season. Rose returned to play in 2013–14, but during a regular
        season game against the Portland Trail Blazers on November 22, 2013, Rose injured his right meniscus which
        caused
        him to miss the remainder of the season. He returned once again the following season, but knee injuries
        continued
        to impact his availability and his production. In June 2016, he was traded to the New York Knicks, where he
        finished
        the final year of his contract. He signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers on a minimum salary for the 2017–18
        season
        but was hobbled by ankle injuries, which led to him being traded and subsequently waived by the Utah Jazz in
        February 2018. He signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves a month later on a rest-of-season contract; he stayed
        with the team through the following season and enjoyed a career renaissance as a sixth man off the bench despite
        missing 31 games due to injury management. For the 2019–20 season, the Detroit Pistons signed him to his first
        non-minimum salary contract since 2012, and he continued to be successful off the bench. The following season,
        he
        was reunited with his former coach Tom Thibodeau when the New York Knicks re-acquired him in a trade.</p></div>

    Derrick Martell Rose was born on October 4, 1988, in Chicago, Illinois. Raised without a father in the tough
    Englewood section of Chicago, Rose and his three older brothers were under the constant, watchful eye of their
    strict and loving mother, Brenda.

    "My mom would walk down the street and drag us home if she heard we were getting into trouble," Rose later told
    Sports Illustrated. "Even the drug dealers, when they saw her coming, would stop dealing and tell her where we
    were."

    The Rose family was tight, and Derrick's three brothers—Dwayne, Reggie and Allan—took on a fatherly role when it
    came to their youngest brother. By the eighth grade, Rose's talent as a basketball player was readily apparent. The
    slick-moving point guard with exceptional court vision was a rising star in his home city, and to protect him from
    outside interests, his older siblings were constantly at his side. One or more would pick him up and drop him off at
    school. They also attended his practices and punished him if he stepped out of line.

    In 2003, Rose enrolled at Chicago's Simeon Academy and quickly catapulted to one of the country's best high school
    players. His dominant career at the school resulted in numerous wins and awards. In his senior season, Rose, who by
    then was ranked as the nation's best high school point guard, averaged 25.2 points per game and guided Simeon to a
    33-2 record and its second consecutive state title. That same year, the Chicago Tribune named Rose its 2007
    "Illinois Mr. Basketball."

    By the time Rose enrolled at Simeon Career Academy in 2003, he was a hot commodity for collegiate coaches. Despite
    his reputation, he played freshmen and JV basketball for the Wolverines. He wore No. 25 in honor of Ben "Benji"
    Wilson, a promising player who was murdered by a gang member during his senior year in 1984. Rose was not
    allowed on varsity due to a long-standing tradition that head coach Bob Hambric, who had been with the school since
    1980 had no freshmen on the varsity team. That rule did not lessen Rose's play, and he went on to put up 1<u>8.5
    points, 6.6 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 2.1 steals per game</u> and led both the freshmen and sophomores to city
    championships with a 24–1 record. Hambric softened his stance and allowed the freshman a chance to play on
    varsity in the state tournament, but Rose declined, wanting the players to get due credit. The next year Hambric
    retired and Robert Smith was hired, opening the path to varsity. In Rose's debut, he had 22 points, 7 rebounds and 5
    steals over Thornwood High School in a sold-out game filled with college scouts and coaches. He led the
    Wolverines to a 30–5 mark while averaging 19.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 8.3 assists and 2.4 steals but the season ended
    after a loss in state regionals. Rose's play garnered him his first national award: a Parade All-American third team
    spot.

    During Rose's junior year in 2006, the Simeon Wolverines broke through and won the Chicago Public League
    championship held at the United Center, where Rose starred with <b>25 points and crowd pleasing dunks</b>. The team
    advanced through the playoffs and earned a berth in the Class AA state championship against Richwoods High School,
    where a fourth quarter buzzer beater by Richwood forced overtime. The score was knotted at 29 late in the extra
    period when Rose stole the ball and buried the game winning jumper as time expired, giving Simeon its first state
    title since the Wilson-led Wolverines won in 1984. The team finished 33–4 and ranked nationally, and Rose was
    awarded with an All-State Illinois mention, EA Sports All-American Second Team pick and another Parade
    All-American selection.

    Entering his senior year, Rose was ranked the <b>fifth best prospect</b> in the nation by Sports Illustrated. In
    January
    2007, Simeon traveled to Madison Square Garden to play Rice High School and star guard Kemba Walker. The
    Wolverines lost 53–51. The season's highlight was a nationally televised contest on ESPN against Virginia
    perennial power Oak Hill Academy two weeks later. Matched up with hyped junior guard Brandon Jennings, Rose had 28
    points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds and in a 78–75 win. For his performance, USA Today named him their high
    school player of the week. Simeon went on to repeat as Public League champions and defended their state
    championship, defeating O'Fallon High School 77–54. In doing so, Simeon became the first Chicago Public League
    school to win two straight state championships. In his final high school game, Rose scored 2 points, but pulled down
    7 rebounds and totaled 8 assists, while Simeon big man Tim Flowers scored 35 points. The Wolverines ended the
    season 33–2 and ranked first in the nation by Sports Illustrated and 6th on USA Today's Super 25. Rose
    averaged 25.2 points, 9.1 assists, 8.8 rebounds and 3.4 steals.

    Overall, Simeon's record while Rose played was 120–12. After his senior year, Rose was again All-State after
    being named Illinois Mr. Basketball and was named to the McDonald's All-American team. He was also awarded
    with First Team honors by Parade selection and USA Today and USA Today First Team All-American.

    Rose was selected to play in the Jordan Brand All-Star Game and Nike Hoop Summit. In 2009, Rose was named the
    decade's third greatest high school point guard by ESPN RISE magazine behind Chris Paul and T.J. Ford, and had
    his jersey number (#25) retired along with Ben Wilson.

    Rose accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Memphis Tigers under John Calipari, who recruited him
    after seeing him play in an AAU game.[34] Strong efforts were made by Indiana University and in-state University of
    Illinois to sign Rose to their own programs.[35] Illinois in particular planned to pair Rose and their five-star
    recruit Eric Gordon, who had played AAU basketball with Rose.[36] Gordon, however, retracted his verbal commitment
    from the Fighting Illini, opting to play for Indiana, and Rose subsequently gave his verbal commitment before the
    start of his senior season.[37] Rose chose Memphis because of the school's history of putting players in the NBA and
    the prospect of Rod Strickland, a 17-year veteran of the league, mentoring him. Rose switched to #23, due to the
    fact that #25 had been retired by the school in honor of Penny Hardaway.[38]

    With the addition of Rose and led by veteran upperclassmen Joey Dorsey and Chris Douglas-Roberts, the Tigers started
    out the season ranked third in the nation. Memphis sprinted to a 26–0 start and claimed the number one ranking in
    the country for the first time in over 25 years before falling to the University of Tennessee Volunteers 66–62 in
    February.[39] Memphis was able to bounce back and capture the Conference USA Tournament to qualify for the "Big
    Dance" with a 33–1 record.[40] Rose averaged 14.9 points per game, 4.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game during the
    regular season and earned All-American Third Team honors among others.[41] He finished as a finalist for the Bob
    Cousy Award as well as the John R. Wooden Award.[42]

    Memphis was seeded No. 1 in the South Region. Rose earned high praise for his increased focus on defense, hounding
    Texas Longhorn guard D. J. Augustin into a low-percentage game in the Elite Eight.[43] In a match-up against UCLA in
    the Final Four, Rose finished with 25 points and 9 rebounds to lead the Tigers to an 85–67 win and a trip to the
    NCAA championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks.[44] The win set an NCAA mark for most wins in a season (38).[45]
    Against Kansas, Rose scored 17 points on 7–of–17 shooting, along with six rebounds and seven assists, but missed a
    critical free throw at the end of the second half as Memphis fell in overtime, 75–68.[46] Memphis concluded the
    season 38–2. Rose was named to the All-Final Four team after averaging <b>20.8 points, 6.5 rebounds and 6.0
    assists</b> per
    game.[47]

    On April 15, Rose announced he would forgo his final three seasons at Memphis and declared for the 2008 NBA draft.
